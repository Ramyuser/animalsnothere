        <h1>One of four subspecies of the Spanish Ibex or Iberian Goat that was found in the Iberian Peninsula. The Ibex would grow to a height of 60-76cm at the shoulder and weigh 24-80 kg and fed mainly on grasses and herbs. They were thought to have numbered
            50,000 historically, but by the early 1900s its numbers had fallen to fewer than 100. The exact cause of the Pyrenean Ibexâ€™s extinction is unknown; scientists believe factors included poaching and the inability to compete with other mammals
            for food and habitat. The last Pyrenean Ibex was killed by a falling tree in northern Spain in 2000.</h1>
